<h2 id="About">About The Cover</h2><p class="text-justify">The cover features a myriad of elements designed to embody the journal, including its logo featured beside its name. Set in front of a leaf-textured green background, three test tubes are shown; this overall image symbolizes the three biological science studies in the journal. Behind it, a circuit board in violet represents the study under Embedded Systems with the hand and water tank illustrating the Material Science manuscript geared toward water filtration.</p>
<p class="text-justify">To immortalize the works of science present in these studies, the title bears to live up to its definition. Amaranthine, meaning undying, is derived from the Greek words amarantos and anthos, immortal and flower, respectively. Like the word, the makers of this journal believe that the quest for knowledge and passion for science are things that never truly cease; they only bloom with time.</p>
<p class="text-justify">Yellow, one of the 2021 colors of the year that is known to symbolize the energy in literature, and a violet-green dua-chromatic main scheme represents the colors of the cover. The prominent colors (green and violet) are the two primary colors from the progression of the amaranthine plant: as a symbol of development and growth. As the process of research is, the maturation of amaranthine is identical to the procedures in the duration of a research project. In order for the buds to reach full bloom, a method must take action.</p>
<p class="text-justify">In coherence to City High’s well-known axiom: Soar High, City High, this research journal aims for the same. This collective and collaborative scientific work displays as an epitome of patience and perseverance. As seeds for an immortal flower, everlasting.</p>

<h2 id="About">About BCNHS</h2><p class="text-justify">Standing amidst a bustling city, Bacolod City National High School has evolved through time together with the course of science. Founded in 1948, the school has since then upheld the honor and continuously strives for excellence in the academe.</p>
<p class="text-justify">In the past year, the public high school had over 7000 students in Grades 7-12. In junior high school (JHS), the school has four programs to cater to the future careers of the student body: Basic Education Curriculum (BEC), Special Program for the Arts (SPA), Special Program for Sports (SPS), and the Science, Technology, and Engineering (STE) Curriculum.</p>
<p class="text-justify">In senior high school (SHS), four strands are offered by the institution namely: Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics Track (STEM), Accountancy and Business Management (ABM), Humanities and Social Sciences (HUMSS), and Technical-Vocational Livelihood (TVL).</p>
<p class="text-justify">The Research Unit of the aforementioned school comprises students and faculty in the STE and STEM departments at junior and senior high school levels. The JHS students have entered through an entrance examination in which the program would include those who have ranked in the top 120. They have been in training since their freshman year and are continually evolving in the field of research.</p>
<p class="text-justify">The academic institution consistently produces students equipped with an outstanding education to become well-rounded professionals with the hearts and minds to serve the country.</p>

<br><br>
<h2 id="BCNHS">BCNHS Research Program</h2><p class="text-justify">The Research Program of Bacolod City National High is a 4-year undertaking that follows a curriculum developed by the Department of Education for Science, Technology, and Engineering Students. As a subject, it is offered to start from Grade 7 where each year, aspects of research knowledge and skills are sequentially taught and put into practice and application until the final year, Grade 10.</p>
<br><br>
<h3 id="Grade">Grade 7</h3><p class="text-justify">Research is introduced in the Grade 7 Level. In this formative year, discussed to learners are concepts on Scientific Attitude, Basic Science Process Skills, Integrated Process Skills, and Scientific Method. They are also guided to demonstrate skills in observation and inference, identify a research problem, design a simple experiment using integrated process skills, and effectively communicate its results in oral and written form. Research I culminates with the conduct of a simple scientific investigation using the scientific method and writing a simple scientific report.</p>
<br><br>
<h3 id="Grade">Grade 8</h3><p class="text-justify">Research in the Grade 8 Level is the introduction to the research process. In this reinforcement year, the nature of research is described from its meaning, characteristics, and importance. Classification of research problems is also highlighted with emphasis on the determination of its sources and appropriate steps in planning and design. The importance of a good literature review is also discussed among learners, including standard use of citation, writing bibliographic format, proper scientific writing, and ethics such as intellectual property and plagiarism. Since proposal writing begins at this level, learners are taught to apply principles of research design, sampling, data collection, analysis, and presentation. They are also prepared for laboratory activities with discussions on procedures, techniques, and proper handling of equipment. Research II ends with the writing of the research proposal.</p>
<br><br>
<h3 id="Grade">Grade 9</h3><p class="text-justify">Research 9 brings learners to the actual conduct of investigation and experimentation. Learners revisit and refine their research proposals incorporating recommendations by experts. They also familiarize parts of the research paper and the IMRAD format. The actual experimentation phase is also done at this level, collection, organization, analysis, and interpretation of data follow. Learners are trained to select appropriate instruments for data collection, organize data in a project notebook, use appropriate statistical tools, test hypotheses, and draw conclusions. Research III concludes with the writing and presentation of the research report.</p>
<br><br>
<h3 id="Grade">Grade 10</h3><p class="text-justify">Research 10 is the culmination of the research curriculum in the STE program. Learners complete the research report with evaluation standards and reviews from consultation with experts. The research report is then finalized and reported to the class. Learners are also encouraged to participate in conferences and research activities organized by the Department of Education and other institutions to share their respective study’s findings in both oral and poster presentations. Completed studies are given the opportunity to be published in this journal, Amaranthine, provided that they comply with the review process.</p>

<h2 id="Preface">Preface</h2><p class="text-justify">Bacolod City National High School has produced graduates that have excelled in their own fields of interest and garnered awards in different levels. However, it is common that after competitions and graduations, manuscripts gradually get tossed to the side, buried in the files of a laptop, never to be seen again. This drove the creation of the first-ever journal to be published, making sure that hard works are put into application and contribute to the betterment of society, alongside pursuing the goal of promoting Science and Technology to the minds of the youth.</p>
<p class="text-justify">This journal holds five noteworthy Research studies of students belonging to the Science, Technology, and Engineering Program — who have honed their skills and capabilities since their freshmen year. Of five studies, three are under Biological Science, one works with Embedded Systems, and another tackled Material Science.</p>
<p class="text-justify">Through this journal, we hope to serve as a reminder to anyone who will read this: everything is within our reach as long as we continue to walk. Every effort and initiative we take will always lead us a step closer to our goals and success.</p>
<p class="text-justify">Thus, it is with great pride and delight that we present, Amaranthine.</p>

<br><br>
<h2 id="Dedication">Dedication</h2><p class="text-justify">This journal is wholeheartedly dedicated to Aris C. Larroder for fervidly motivating our generation of curious minds to passionately pursue our love for science. Using your knowledge to help better the world is one thing, but shaping young minds is another. Your essential and dedicated service is meaningful to all of us.</p>
