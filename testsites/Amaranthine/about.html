    <h1>About</h1>
    <hr/>
    <h2 id="About">BCNHS</h2><p class="text-justify">Standing amidst a bustling city, Bacolod City National High School has evolved through time together with the course of science. Founded in 1948, the school has since then upheld the honor and continuously strives for excellence in the academe.</p>
    <p class="text-justify">In the past year, the public high school had over 7000 students in Grades 7-12. In junior high school (JHS), the school has four programs to cater to the future careers of the student body: Basic Education Curriculum (BEC), Special Program for the Arts (SPA), Special Program for Sports (SPS), and the Science, Technology, and Engineering (STE) Curriculum.</p>
    <p class="text-justify">In senior high school (SHS), four strands are offered by the institution namely: Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics Track (STEM), Accountancy and Business Management (ABM), Humanities and Social Sciences (HUMSS), and Technical-Vocational Livelihood (TVL).</p>
    <p class="text-justify">The Research Unit of the aforementioned school comprises students and faculty in the STE and STEM departments at junior and senior high school levels. The JHS students have entered through an entrance examination in which the program would include those who have ranked in the top 120. They have been in training since their freshman year and are continually evolving in the field of research.</p>
    <p class="text-justify">The academic institution consistently produces students equipped with an outstanding education to become well-rounded professionals with the hearts and minds to serve the country.</p>
    
    <br><br>
    <h2 id="BCNHS">BCNHS Research Program</h2><p class="text-justify">The Research Program of Bacolod City National High is a 4-year undertaking that follows a curriculum developed by the Department of Education for Science, Technology, and Engineering Students. As a subject, it is offered to start from Grade 7 where each year, aspects of research knowledge and skills are sequentially taught and put into practice and application until the final year, Grade 10.</p>
    <br><br>
    <h3 id="Grade">Grade 7</h3><p class="text-justify">Research is introduced in the Grade 7 Level. In this formative year, discussed to learners are concepts on Scientific Attitude, Basic Science Process Skills, Integrated Process Skills, and Scientific Method. They are also guided to demonstrate skills in observation and inference, identify a research problem, design a simple experiment using integrated process skills, and effectively communicate its results in oral and written form. Research I culminates with the conduct of a simple scientific investigation using the scientific method and writing a simple scientific report.</p>
    <br><br>
    <h3 id="Grade">Grade 8</h3><p class="text-justify">Research in the Grade 8 Level is the introduction to the research process. In this reinforcement year, the nature of research is described from its meaning, characteristics, and importance. Classification of research problems is also highlighted with emphasis on the determination of its sources and appropriate steps in planning and design. The importance of a good literature review is also discussed among learners, including standard use of citation, writing bibliographic format, proper scientific writing, and ethics such as intellectual property and plagiarism. Since proposal writing begins at this level, learners are taught to apply principles of research design, sampling, data collection, analysis, and presentation. They are also prepared for laboratory activities with discussions on procedures, techniques, and proper handling of equipment. Research II ends with the writing of the research proposal.</p>
    <br><br>
    <h3 id="Grade">Grade 9</h3><p class="text-justify">Research 9 brings learners to the actual conduct of investigation and experimentation. Learners revisit and refine their research proposals incorporating recommendations by experts. They also familiarize parts of the research paper and the IMRAD format. The actual experimentation phase is also done at this level, collection, organization, analysis, and interpretation of data follow. Learners are trained to select appropriate instruments for data collection, organize data in a project notebook, use appropriate statistical tools, test hypotheses, and draw conclusions. Research III concludes with the writing and presentation of the research report.</p>
    <br><br>
    <h3 id="Grade">Grade 10</h3><p class="text-justify">Research 10 is the culmination of the research curriculum in the STE program. Learners complete the research report with evaluation standards and reviews from consultation with experts. The research report is then finalized and reported to the class. Learners are also encouraged to participate in conferences and research activities organized by the Department of Education and other institutions to share their respective studyâ€™s findings in both oral and poster presentations. Completed studies are given the opportunity to be published in this journal, Amaranthine, provided that they comply with the review process.</p>
